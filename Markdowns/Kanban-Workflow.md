# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How a Kanban Board Works and How It Helps Manage Workflow
A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that helps teams track tasks as they move through different stages of work. Each task is represented as a card and progresses from left to right across the board. This visual approach provides transparency, helps identify bottlenecks, and ensures work is completed efficiently and in priority order.

Kanban supports continuous delivery by allowing tasks to flow through the system without fixed sprint cycles.

### Kanban Board Columns and Their Meaning

Common Kanban board columns include:

- **Not Started / Backlog**  
  Tasks that are planned but not yet started.

- **In Progress**  
  Tasks currently being worked on.

- **Blocked**  
  Tasks that cannot continue due to dependencies, missing information, or technical issues.

- **Ready for Review**  
  Tasks that are complete and awaiting code review, testing, or approval.

- **Approved / Done**  
  Tasks that have been reviewed, approved, and completed.

These columns represent the lifecycle of a task from idea to completion.

### How Tasks Move Through the Board and Responsibility
Tasks move across the board as work progresses:
- A task is moved to **In Progress** when work begins.
- If an issue arises, it is moved to **Blocked**.
- Once completed, it moves to **Ready for Review**.
- After approval or automated checks, it moves to **Approved / Done**.

The person working on the task is responsible for updating its status to keep the board accurate and up to date.

### Benefits of Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
Limiting WIP means restricting how many tasks can be worked on at the same time. Benefits include:
- Reduced multitasking
- Faster task completion
- Better focus and productivity
- Easier identification of bottlenecks
- Improved quality of work

WIP limits encourage completing tasks before starting new ones.

## 📝 Reflection

### How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities and Avoid Overload
Kanban helps manage priorities by making all work visible and ordered. By limiting WIP, it prevents overload and reduces stress. High-priority tasks are addressed first, while lower-priority tasks remain in the backlog until capacity is available.

### How I Can Improve My Workflow Using Kanban Principles
I can improve my workflow by:
- Updating task status consistently
- Limiting myself to one or two tasks in progress
- Breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable cards
- Reviewing the Kanban board daily to track progress

These practices help maintain focus and improve delivery speed.
