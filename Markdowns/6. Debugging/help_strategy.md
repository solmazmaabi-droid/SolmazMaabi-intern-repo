# 📌 When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?

## ❓ When do you prefer using AI vs searching Google?

I prefer using AI tools when I need conceptual explanations, alternative approaches, or example code tailored to a specific scenario. AI is especially helpful when I am unsure how different pieces fit together or when I want quick feedback on logic. I prefer Google when dealing with specific error messages, official documentation, or version-dependent issues, as search results often provide authoritative and verified information.

## ❓ How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I decide to ask a colleague when I have already attempted to solve the problem independently and am still blocked, or when the issue involves shared code, architecture, or business logic. I also ask for help when the problem is time-sensitive or could have broader impact if handled incorrectly. Before asking, I try to clearly explain what I have tried and where I am stuck.

## ❓ What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

When troubleshooting alone, developers can lose time due to tunnel vision, make incorrect assumptions, or repeatedly try ineffective solutions. It can also be difficult to recognise gaps in understanding without external feedback. Working in isolation may increase frustration and lead to overcomplicated solutions, whereas collaboration often brings faster and clearer problem resolution.
