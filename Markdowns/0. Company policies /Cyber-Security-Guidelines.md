# 🔒 Cyber Security

## 🎯 Goal

To understand how to protect company and user data by following cyber security best practices and developing strong security habits while working at Focus Bear.

## ❓ Why Is This Important?

Cyber security breaches can result in data leaks, financial loss, legal consequences, and reputational damage. In a remote work environment, individuals are often the first line of defence. By following good security practices, every team member helps protect Focus Bear’s systems, users, and data.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### Common Cyber Security Threats in a Remote Work Environment

Common threats include:

- Phishing emails and malicious links
- Compromised or weak passwords
- Unsecured Wi-Fi networks
- Malware or ransomware attacks
- Social engineering attempts
- Lost or stolen devices

Remote work increases exposure to these risks if security practices are not followed consistently.

### Best Practices for Keeping Devices and Accounts Secure

Best practices include:

- Keeping operating systems and software up to date
- Using strong, unique passwords for each account
- Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Locking devices when unattended
- Avoiding public or unsecured Wi-Fi without a VPN
- Using trusted security and antivirus tools

---

### Importance of Locking Your Computer When Away

Locking your computer prevents unauthorised access to company systems and sensitive information. Even short periods away from a desk can create an opportunity for data exposure, especially in shared or public environments.

---

### Handling Phishing Attempts and Suspicious Links

If a message or link appears suspicious:

- Do not click links or download attachments
- Verify the sender’s identity
- Check for spelling errors or unusual requests
- Report the message to the appropriate team or supervisor
- Delete the message once reported

Caution helps prevent credential theft and malware infections.

---

### Strong Passwords and Password Managers

A strong password:

- Is long (at least 12–16 characters)
- Uses a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Is unique for each account

Password managers help generate, store, and manage strong passwords securely, reducing the risk of reuse or exposure.

---

### Importance of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (such as a code or biometric). Even if a password is compromised, 2FA significantly reduces the chance of unauthorised access. It should be enabled on all work-related accounts whenever possible.

## 📝 Reflection

### Current Security Measures and Areas for Improvement

Currently, I follow basic security practices such as using strong passwords and keeping my devices updated. I can improve by being more consistent with locking my devices and reviewing account permissions regularly.

---

### Making Secure Behaviour a Habit

Secure behaviour can become a habit by:

- Enabling automatic device locks
- Using password managers to remove friction
- Treating security checks as part of daily workflow
- Staying aware of common threats

Consistency reduces the likelihood of mistakes.

---

### Ensuring Password and Account Security

To secure my accounts, I will:

- Use a password manager for all work accounts
- Enable 2FA wherever available
- Avoid reusing passwords
- Review account security settings regularly

---

### Responding to Suspected Security Breaches

If I suspect suspicious activity or a security breach, I will:

1. Immediately change affected passwords
2. Enable or verify 2FA
3. Report the issue to my supervisor or security contact
4. Follow company procedures for investigation and response

Quick action helps limit potential damage.

## 🛠️ Task

### New Cyber Security Habit

One new cyber security habit I will follow at Focus Bear is **locking my computer whenever I step away from my desk**, even for short periods. This simple habit significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive information.
