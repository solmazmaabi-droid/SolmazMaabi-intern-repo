# 🤖 Use of AI Tools

## 🎯 Goal
To understand how to use AI tools responsibly and effectively while maintaining data privacy, critical thinking, and professional standards at Focus Bear.

---

## ❓ Why Is This Important?
AI tools can significantly improve productivity and efficiency, especially in software development and knowledge work. However, misuse—such as sharing confidential data, blindly trusting AI output, or over-relying on automation—can lead to security risks, incorrect decisions, and reduced skill development. Responsible use ensures AI remains a helpful assistant rather than a liability.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### AI Tools Commonly Used in My Role
In a front-end developer role, AI tools may be used for:
- Code suggestions and refactoring
- Explaining unfamiliar code or concepts
- Generating boilerplate code or documentation
- Debugging assistance and error explanations
- Improving written communication (e.g., documentation or messages)

These tools are used to support, not replace, developer judgement.

### Benefits and Risks of Using AI in a Professional Setting

**Benefits:**
- Faster problem-solving and ideation
- Increased productivity
- Support when learning new technologies
- Assistance with repetitive or boilerplate tasks

**Risks:**
- Sharing confidential or sensitive information
- Inaccurate or outdated outputs
- Over-reliance leading to reduced critical thinking
- Potential bias or misleading responses

Understanding both benefits and risks is essential for responsible use.

### Information That Should Never Be Entered into AI Tools
The following information should never be shared with AI tools:
- Personal data of users or team members
- Confidential business information
- Access tokens, API keys, or passwords
- Internal documents or proprietary code
- Any data protected by privacy or security policies

Maintaining confidentiality is a core responsibility.

### Fact-Checking and Validating AI-Generated Content
To ensure accuracy, AI-generated content should be:
- Cross-checked against official documentation
- Reviewed for logical consistency
- Tested in practice (e.g., running code locally)
- Verified with teammates or trusted sources if unsure

AI output should always be treated as a starting point, not a final answer.

## 📝 Reflection

### When to Use AI vs. My Own Skills
I should use AI when I need help brainstorming, understanding unfamiliar concepts, or speeding up repetitive tasks. I should rely on my own skills when making architectural decisions, writing critical logic, or handling sensitive or high-impact work.

---

### Avoiding Over-Reliance on AI
To avoid over-reliance, I can:
- Try solving problems independently first
- Use AI to validate or improve my solution rather than replace it
- Continue learning core concepts instead of copying answers
- Reflect on AI output instead of accepting it blindly

This ensures continued skill development.

---

### Ensuring Data Privacy When Using AI Tools
To protect data privacy, I will:
- Never input confidential or sensitive information
- Use anonymised or generic examples when asking questions
- Follow company policies on AI usage
- Be mindful of what data I share and why

## 🛠️ Task

### Task Improved Using an AI Tool
One task I improved using an AI tool was generating a clear outline for documentation. The AI helped structure the content, which I then customised and refined.

---

### Reviewing AI-Generated Output
The AI-generated output required editing to improve clarity, remove unnecessary information, and ensure accuracy. Fact-checking was necessary to confirm technical details.

---

### Best Practice I Will Follow at Focus Bear
One best practice I will follow is to **treat AI as an assistant, not an authority**, and always review, validate, and adapt AI-generated content before using it in my work.
