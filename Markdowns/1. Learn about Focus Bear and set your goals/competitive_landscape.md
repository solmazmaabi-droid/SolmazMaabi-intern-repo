## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear stands out because it is not just a blocker or a planner. It combines **distraction blocking + habit routines + guided focus + break reminders** in a way that feels designed for people who struggle with executive functioning (especially ADHD/Autism, but also anyone who feels overwhelmed or easily distracted).

In comparison:

- **Freedom** focuses mainly on **blocking websites/apps across devices** with scheduled sessions.
- **Cold Turkey** is a very strict blocker with strong controls for people who need “hard mode” (highly restrictive blocking).
- **Tiimo** is more about **visual planning and structure**, supporting day planning and task organisation in an ADHD/Autism-friendly way.
- **Routinery** focuses on **step-by-step routines** with timers to guide you through daily routines.

Focus Bear’s difference is the **combination**: it supports both building routines and protecting focus from distractions, while also encouraging sustainable habits (breaks, structure, follow-through).

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

If I wanted support beyond just blocking or just planning, I would choose Focus Bear because it helps with _starting tasks and staying consistent_, not only removing distractions. I would choose it because:

- It provides **structure through routines**, which helps when I feel overwhelmed.
- It supports focus with **blocking and prompts**, which reduces impulsive distractions.
- It encourages **breaks and sustainability**, which helps avoid burnout.
- It feels designed to support people who struggle silently with focus and follow-through, instead of only relying on willpower.

Freedom or Cold Turkey would be better if my only goal was strict blocking. Tiimo or Routinery would be better if my only goal was planning and routine guidance. Focus Bear feels like a more complete support system because it combines both.

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

One feature competitors offer that Focus Bear could improve or make more visible is **strong “strict mode” enforcement** and/or **cross-device syncing of blocking rules**:

- **Freedom** is known for strong cross-device blocking sessions and strict options that reduce the ability to override focus sessions.
- **Cold Turkey** is known for very strict blocking controls (useful for users who need strong guardrails).
- **Routinery** highlights automation-style triggers (e.g., routines that can be tied to contexts like location).
- **Tiimo** focuses heavily on visual scheduling and planning tools that may feel more like a dedicated planner.

Even if Focus Bear has some of these features, competitors communicate these strengths very clearly, which makes them stand out to users who are comparing options.

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement Focus Bear could make?

One improvement Focus Bear could make is to add or strengthen **context-aware automation and stricter focus controls**, such as:

- Stronger cross-device enforcement so focus sessions feel consistent across phone + laptop

This would help users who need both supportive routine guidance and strong protection against impulsive distractions, while also making Focus Bear more competitive with Freedom and Cold Turkey.
