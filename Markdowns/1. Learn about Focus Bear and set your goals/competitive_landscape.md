## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear seems positioned as an **anti-distraction + routine + anti-burnout** tool designed specifically with **AuDHD (ADHD + Autism) needs** in mind, not just “blocking distractions”. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Compared to competitors:
- **Freedom** focuses strongly on **blocking websites/apps across devices** with schedules and blocklists. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Cold Turkey** is a “tough” blocker with very granular controls like blocking keywords and even the entire internet. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Tiimo** is primarily a **visual planner** built for ADHD/Autism with visual structure and planning tools (timers, checklists, planning). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Routinery** emphasises **routine execution** using a step-by-step timer and can include context triggers like location-based reminders. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

What stands out about Focus Bear is the combination of:
- guided routines and breaks (anti-burnout approach) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- distraction blocking and intention prompts during focus sessions :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- clear positioning for AuDHD users :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
If I wanted a tool that helps me **follow through** (not just plan or block), I would choose Focus Bear because it combines:
- **routines + break reminders** (helps reduce burnout and keeps me physically moving) :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **blocking distractions during focus sessions**, plus “intention before use” prompts outside sessions :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- a product designed for people who struggle with executive functioning (AuDHD positioning) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  

Freedom and Cold Turkey are strong if the main problem is “I need a strict blocker”. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
Tiimo and Routinery are strong if the main problem is “I need help planning my day and sequencing tasks”. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
Focus Bear feels like a middle-ground that supports both **behaviour change and protection from distractions**. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
One feature I saw in competitors that I **did not notice clearly described on Focus Bear’s public feature pages** is **location-based triggers** for routines (e.g., starting a routine when you arrive somewhere). Routinery explicitly highlights location-driven routines/reminders. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  

(If Focus Bear does have this, it wasn’t obvious from the pages I reviewed, so improving how it’s communicated could also help.) :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

## Based on your research, what’s one improvement Focus Bear could make?
A practical improvement would be to add (or strengthen) **context-aware automation**—for example:
- location-based routine suggestions (“When I arrive at uni/work/home, start my routine”)
- smarter triggers based on time + context (e.g., calendar event + location)

This could reduce friction for users who struggle with transitions and task initiation, and it aligns well with Focus Bear’s “make good habits easier” approach. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
