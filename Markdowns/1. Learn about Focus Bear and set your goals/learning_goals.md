# 📌 What Do You Want to Learn & Contribute?

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
From this internship, I hope to gain real-world experience working in a professional software development team. I want to better understand how products are built and maintained in practice, including how tasks are prioritised, how teams collaborate remotely, and how decisions are made beyond just writing code. I am especially interested in learning how a product like Focus Bear balances technical requirements with user needs, accessibility, and wellbeing.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I am most excited to develop my **front-end development skills**, particularly working with React, APIs, and real production codebases. I am also keen to improve my skills in writing clean, maintainable code and understanding how front-end work integrates with back-end systems. Beyond technical skills, I am excited to develop communication skills, such as asking better questions, explaining my work clearly, and collaborating more confidently with others.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
I believe I can contribute a strong attention to detail, a thoughtful approach to user experience, and a genuine interest in building tools that support people rather than overwhelm them. Because I relate personally to Focus Bear’s mission, I am motivated to think carefully about accessibility, clarity, and inclusivity in the product. I am also reliable, willing to learn, and open to feedback, which I think is important when contributing as an intern.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
One area I feel less confident in is **speaking up and asking questions**, especially when I am unsure about something. In the past, I sometimes hesitated to ask for clarification, which could slow my learning. Through this internship, I want to become more comfortable asking questions early and communicating when I need help or more context.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success in this internship would mean that I have grown both technically and personally. This includes feeling more confident in my skills, contributing meaningful work to the team, and understanding how to work effectively in an Agile, remote environment. It would also mean leaving the internship knowing I supported Focus Bear’s mission in a positive way and feeling better prepared for future roles in the tech industry.
