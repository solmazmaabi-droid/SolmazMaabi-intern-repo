## Understanding Focus Bear’s Mission & Vision

### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I believe Focus Bear was created to support people who struggle with focus, motivation, and consistency in their daily lives, particularly those who find traditional productivity tools overwhelming or ineffective. Many people experience difficulties with executive functioning, especially in environments like university or work where expectations are high but support is limited. Focus Bear appears to have been designed to provide structure and guidance in a way that is supportive rather than demanding.

### What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear addresses challenges related to executive functioning, such as difficulty starting tasks, maintaining focus, managing time, and building consistent habits. These challenges are common for people with ADHD or Autism, but they also affect many people without a formal diagnosis. Focus Bear helps reduce overwhelm by breaking tasks into manageable steps and encouraging focus in a structured, predictable way.

### Why do you think this mission is important?

This mission is important because struggles with focus and organisation can significantly affect academic performance, confidence, and mental wellbeing. When these difficulties are misunderstood, people often blame themselves or feel inadequate. Tools like Focus Bear are important because they recognise that not everyone works the same way and that productivity support should be flexible, inclusive, and compassionate.

### How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear’s work aligns strongly with my personal values around accessibility, inclusivity, and using technology to genuinely support people. I value tools that reduce pressure rather than increase it and that acknowledge different ways of thinking and working. As someone interested in front-end development, I am also drawn to Focus Bear’s emphasis on clear, user-friendly design that avoids unnecessary complexity.

### Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I relate to these challenges personally. I was diagnosed with autism by a psychologist, and during university I struggled both socially and academically. I often didn’t ask questions even when I needed clarification, not because I wasn’t engaged, but because it felt overwhelming or intimidating. I also found it difficult to make friends, which made the university experience feel isolating at times. Managing focus, motivation, and routines was challenging, especially when tasks were unclear or when I felt behind.

### Do you know someone with ADHD or Autism, or someone without a diagnosis who struggled socially or academically? How might Focus Bear help them?

Yes — myself. Being diagnosed with autism helped me better understand why I struggled at university, particularly with communication, asking questions, and managing focus. I often hesitated to seek help and found social interactions difficult, which affected both my confidence and academic performance.

Focus Bear could help someone like me by providing clear structure, predictable routines, and guidance without social pressure. Tools that reduce distractions, break tasks into smaller steps, and support focus in a calm, non-judgemental way would make it easier to start tasks and stay engaged. Having a system that supports productivity without relying on constant social interaction or self-advocacy would be especially helpful for people who struggle silently or find it hard to ask for help.
