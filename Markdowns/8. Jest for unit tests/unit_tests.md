# 📌 Introduction to Unit Testing with Jest

## Why is automated testing important in software development?
Automated testing helps detect bugs early, prevents regressions when features change, and improves overall code reliability. It allows developers to refactor code with confidence and ensures consistent behaviour across updates, which is critical for production applications.

## What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?
The most challenging part was configuring Jest correctly to work with modern JavaScript modules. Since newer versions of Jest no longer include the `jsdom` environment by default, understanding how to install and configure the testing environment was essential. Once the setup was complete, writing the actual test logic was straightforward.
