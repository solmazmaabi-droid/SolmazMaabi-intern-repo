# 📌 Creating & Reviewing Pull Requests

## What is a Pull Request (PR) and why is it used?
A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes from a branch into another branch (usually `main`). It is used to show what changes were made, why they were made, and to allow other people to review the work before it becomes part of the main codebase. PRs create a clear space for discussion, review, and approval, which helps teams collaborate safely.

## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
PRs are important because they:
- Improve code quality through review and feedback
- Reduce the chance of bugs reaching the main branch
- Create a documented history of decisions and changes
- Help teams collaborate by making work visible and trackable
- Encourage consistent standards (style, testing, security, performance)

In a team environment, PRs also help ensure that changes are understood by more than one person, which reduces knowledge silos.

## What makes a well-structured PR?
A well-structured PR usually includes:
- A clear and descriptive **title** (what the PR does)
- A short **summary** explaining the purpose of the change
- Specific details about **what changed** and **why**
- Steps to **test** the changes (or evidence of testing)
- Screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes (if relevant)
- Small scope where possible (focused changes are easier to review)
- Links to related issues or tasks (if applicable)

A good PR makes it easy for reviewers to understand the change quickly and give useful feedback.

## What I learned from reviewing an open-source PR
When I reviewed a PR in a public open-source repository, I noticed that:
- Reviews often focus on readability, maintainability, and long-term impact, not just whether the code works
- Reviewers ask for changes politely and give clear reasoning
- Discussions can include alternatives and trade-offs, especially around performance and edge cases
- Many PRs include automated checks (tests, formatting, linting) and reviewers rely on those signals too

This showed me that reviewing is not about criticism—it’s about improving the quality of the final result and helping the team share responsibility for the codebase.

## Requesting feedback on my PR
To request feedback from a peer or mentor, I would:
- Share the PR link directly
- Summarise what the PR changes in 1–2 sentences
- Mention what kind of feedback I want (logic, style, UI, edge cases)
- Ask if they can review within a reasonable timeframe

This helps reviewers know what to look for and makes the review process smoother.

## Reflection
Creating PRs encourages better communication and accountability. It also helps me work more carefully because I know my changes will be reviewed. I want to build the habit of making smaller, clearer PRs and writing descriptions that make reviewing easy.
