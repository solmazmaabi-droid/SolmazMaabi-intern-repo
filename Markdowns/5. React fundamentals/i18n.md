# 📌 Implementing Internationalization with i18next

## ❓ What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?

A common challenge was ensuring i18next was initialised exactly once and imported before components tried to use translations. Another challenge was organising translation files and keeping keys consistent across languages. It was also easy to miss small issues like incorrect file paths or forgetting to add a fallback language.

## ❓ Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?

A library like i18next provides a structured and scalable approach to translations, including language switching, fallbacks, interpolation, and pluralisation. Doing this manually becomes difficult to maintain as the number of languages and UI strings grows, and it increases the risk of inconsistent wording and missing translations.

## ❓ How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?

User-generated content usually should not be automatically translated without user consent because it can be inaccurate. I would keep user content in its original language and optionally offer “Translate” as a separate feature (using a translation service), clearly labelling it as a translation. For dynamic UI text (e.g., “Hello, {name}”), I would use i18next interpolation and keep the dynamic values separate from the translation strings.
