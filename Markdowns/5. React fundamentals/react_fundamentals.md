# 📌 Setting Up the Environment

## What challenges did you face during setup?
The main challenge during setup was understanding how Tailwind integrates with React and the build tool. Configuring the `content` paths correctly was important so Tailwind could detect class usage in JSX files. It also took some attention to ensure the Tailwind directives were placed in the correct CSS file used by the application.

Another challenge was verifying that Tailwind was actually working, which I confirmed by applying visible utility classes (layout, colour, and typography) in a React component.

Overall, once the configuration was correct, the setup became straightforward and the developer experience felt smooth and efficient.
