# 📌 Introduction to Redux Toolkit (State Management)

## When should you use Redux instead of useState?

Use **Redux** when your application needs to manage **global state** that is shared across many components, especially as the app grows in size and complexity. Redux is useful when state logic becomes complex, when you need predictable and centralised state updates, or when handling asynchronous data (such as API calls, caching, or loading states). It also improves debugging and maintainability through clear action flows and developer tools.

Use **useState** for **local component state** that is simple and only relevant to a single component or a small part of the UI, such as form inputs, toggles, or modal visibility.
