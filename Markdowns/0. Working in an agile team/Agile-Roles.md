# Roles in an Agile Team

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### Key Roles in an Agile Team

#### Developers
Developers are responsible for designing, building, testing, and maintaining software features. This includes front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers who collaborate to deliver working functionality that meets business and user requirements.

---

#### QA (Quality Assurance)
QA professionals ensure the quality of the product by testing features, identifying bugs, validating requirements, and confirming that software meets acceptance criteria before release.

---

#### Product Manager (PM)
The Product Manager defines the product vision and roadmap. They prioritise the backlog, gather requirements, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure the team is building features that deliver the most value to users and the business.

---

#### Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
The Agile Project Manager facilitates Agile practices, removes blockers, supports team collaboration, and ensures that processes are followed effectively. They help the team stay organised and focused without micromanaging.

---

#### Other Supporting Roles
- **UX/UI Designers:** Create user-friendly and accessible designs.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide business input and feedback.
- **Customer Support:** Share user feedback and real-world issues to improve the product.

### Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum

**Scrum:**
- Work is delivered in fixed-length sprints.
- Roles collaborate through structured ceremonies such as sprint planning, stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives.
- Developers, QA, and PMs work closely within sprint boundaries.

**Kanban:**
- Work flows continuously without fixed sprints.
- Collaboration focuses on maintaining flow, limiting work in progress (WIP), and responding to priorities in real time.
- Roles interact more asynchronously, updating tasks as they move across the board.

Both frameworks encourage transparency and collaboration, but Kanban allows more flexibility while Scrum provides more structure.

## 📝 Reflection

### My Role in the Agile Process
My role is **Front-End Developer**. I contribute to the Agile process by implementing user interface components, ensuring designs are translated accurately into code, and delivering responsive and accessible features. I work closely with other team members to ensure the product meets user and business needs.

---

### Interaction with Other Roles
My responsibilities often overlap with:
- **UX/UI Designers** when implementing designs
- **Back-End Developers** when integrating APIs
- **QA** when fixing bugs and improving usability
- **Product Managers** when clarifying requirements and priorities

Clear communication and timely updates help ensure smooth collaboration.

## 🛠️ Task

### How My Role Fits into the Agile Team
As a front-end developer, I act as the bridge between design and functionality. I take user stories and designs and turn them into interactive, user-facing features while collaborating with QA and back-end developers to ensure quality and performance.

---

### Improving Teamwork with Another Role
I will frequently collaborate with **UX/UI Designers**. I can improve teamwork by:
- Asking questions early if designs are unclear
- Providing feedback on technical feasibility
- Sharing progress updates regularly
- Reviewing designs together before implementation

This helps reduce rework and ensures a better user experience.
