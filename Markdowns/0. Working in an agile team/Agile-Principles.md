### What Is Agile and How Does It Differ from Traditional Project Management?
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to project management that focuses on delivering value incrementally, adapting to change, and encouraging continuous collaboration. Instead of following a fixed, long-term plan, Agile teams work in small increments and adjust based on feedback.

Traditional project management (such as Waterfall) follows a linear process where requirements are defined upfront, changes are limited, and testing occurs late in the project. Agile differs by welcoming change, delivering working software frequently, and involving stakeholders throughout the development process.

### Core Values and Principles of Agile
According to the Agile Manifesto, Agile is based on four core values:
- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change over following a plan**

Agile principles emphasise continuous delivery, customer satisfaction, sustainable development, technical excellence, and regular reflection to improve effectiveness.

### Differences Between Scrum and Kanban

**Scrum**
- Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints (usually 1–2 weeks)
- Requires defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers)
- Work is planned at the start of each sprint
- Progress is reviewed at the end of each sprint

**Kanban**
- Uses continuous workflow without fixed sprints
- Focuses on visualising work and limiting work in progress (WIP)
- Roles are flexible and less prescriptive
- Work is prioritised and delivered continuously

### Why Focus Bear Leans Towards Kanban Instead of Scrum
Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it supports continuous delivery and flexibility. Kanban allows the team to respond quickly to changing priorities, manage workloads more effectively, and collaborate asynchronously across time zones. The visual workflow and WIP limits help maintain focus and reduce bottlenecks without the overhead of sprint ceremonies.

## 📝 Reflection

### Benefits and Challenges of Agile
**Benefits of Agile:**
- Faster feedback and delivery
- Greater flexibility to adapt to change
- Improved collaboration and transparency
- Higher product quality through continuous improvement

**Challenges of Agile:**
- Requires strong communication and discipline
- Can be difficult without clear priorities
- Needs team buy-in and accountability
- Less predictability compared to fixed plans

### How Agile Principles Improve My Role and Responsibilities
Agile principles help improve my role by encouraging frequent communication, adaptability, and ownership of tasks. As a front-end developer, Agile allows me to iterate quickly on user interfaces, respond to feedback early, and collaborate closely with designers and back-end developers. This results in better alignment with user needs and higher-quality outcomes.

### Main Differences Between Scrum and Kanban (In My Own Words)
Scrum focuses on delivering work in fixed time blocks with structured meetings and defined roles, while Kanban focuses on continuous flow, visualising work, and limiting the amount of work in progress at once. Scrum is more structured, while Kanban is more flexible and adaptive.

### Agile Principle Most Useful in My Work
The Agile principle that will be most useful in my work is **responding to change over following a plan**. This principle allows me to adapt quickly to new requirements, feedback, or priorities, which is especially important when developing user interfaces and improving user experience.
