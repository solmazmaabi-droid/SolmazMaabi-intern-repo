# 📌 Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

## Extensions Installed

### React Developer Tools

I installed **React Developer Tools** to inspect the component tree of React applications. This extension allows me to view component props, state, and hooks in real time. It is especially useful for understanding how components are structured and how data flows through the app when debugging UI issues.

**Why I installed it:**  
As a front-end developer working with React, this tool is essential for debugging component behaviour and understanding re-renders.

### Redux DevTools

I installed **Redux DevTools** to debug Redux state changes. It provides visibility into dispatched actions, state before and after updates, and allows time-travel debugging.

**Why I installed it:**  
This tool is helpful for understanding how global state changes over time and for identifying bugs related to incorrect or unexpected state updates.

---

### JSON Viewer

I installed a **JSON Viewer** extension to automatically format and pretty-print JSON responses in the browser.

**Why I installed it:**  
This makes API responses much easier to read and understand when testing endpoints directly in the browser, especially compared to raw, unformatted JSON.

---

### Lighthouse

I installed **Lighthouse** (built into Chrome DevTools) to audit web applications for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

**Why I installed it:**  
Lighthouse helps identify performance bottlenecks and accessibility issues early, which is important for building fast, inclusive, and user-friendly applications.

## Most Useful Thing I Learned

The most useful thing I learned was how powerful **React Developer Tools** is for understanding component behaviour. Being able to inspect props, state, and hooks in real time made it much easier to trace bugs and understand why a component was rendering in a certain way. It also helped me better understand how changes in state affect the UI.

## Overall Reflection

These extensions significantly improve my development workflow by reducing guesswork and making debugging more visual and efficient. Together, they provide better insight into component structure, application state, API responses, and performance, which helps me build and debug applications more confidently.
