# 📌 Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

## Terminal Client Chosen

I chose to use **Terminal.app with zsh**, which is the default terminal setup on macOS. I decided to use this option because it is lightweight, stable, and already integrated into the operating system. Using the default terminal also helps me focus on learning core command-line skills rather than spending too much time configuring additional tools.

## Customisations Made

I made a few small customisations to improve usability and comfort:

- Switched to a **dark theme** to reduce eye strain
- Increased the **font size** for better readability
- Enabled unlimited scrollback so I can easily review previous commands

I did not install additional plugins at this stage, as I wanted to become comfortable with the basics of the command line first.

## Basic Terminal Usage Learned

I spent time practicing common terminal commands such as navigating directories, listing files, and running Git commands. Becoming more comfortable using the terminal helped me understand how development tools and workflows operate behind the scenes, rather than relying only on graphical interfaces.

## Most Useful Command I Learned

The most useful command I learned was:

```bash
ls
```
