## Reflection

### Which shortcuts will be most useful in daily work?

The most useful shortcuts for my daily work will be:

- **Multiple cursors** (`Alt + Click`, `Ctrl + Alt + ↑/↓`, `Ctrl + D`, `Ctrl + Shift + L`) because they save time when I need to update repeated code, refactor variables, or edit multiple lines consistently.
- **Quick Open** (`Ctrl + P`) because I frequently move between files in a React codebase and it’s faster than clicking through folders.
- **Toggle Terminal** (`` Ctrl + ` ``) because I constantly switch between running commands (npm, git) and editing code.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts improve productivity by reducing repetitive mouse use and context switching. They help me stay focused in the editor, complete tasks faster, and reduce interruptions when navigating files, editing code, and debugging. Over time, using shortcuts consistently can make development smoother and help me work more efficiently, especially in larger projects.
