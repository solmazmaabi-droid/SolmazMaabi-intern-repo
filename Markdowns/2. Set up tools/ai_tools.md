# 📌 Set Up AI Tools for Development

## AI Tools I Tried
I experimented with the following AI tools during my development work:

- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension)** – for inline code suggestions and autocompletion.
- **ChatGPT** – for asking coding questions, debugging issues, and explaining unfamiliar concepts.

I focused mainly on using these tools in a front-end / React development context.

## What Worked Well

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot was most useful for:
- Suggesting boilerplate code and common patterns
- Speeding up repetitive tasks such as writing components, handlers, or basic logic
- Providing helpful inline suggestions while typing, which reduced context switching

It was especially effective when I already understood what I wanted to build and just needed help writing it faster.

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT worked well for:
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts in simpler terms
- Helping debug errors by analysing error messages
- Suggesting alternative approaches when I felt stuck
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps

I found it particularly helpful when learning new concepts or trying to understand *why* something wasn’t working.

## What Didn’t Work Well

- AI-generated code sometimes looked correct but required **manual checking and adjustment**
- Copilot occasionally made assumptions that didn’t match the existing codebase or project structure
- ChatGPT responses could be too generic if the question wasn’t specific enough
- Neither tool understands full project context, so relying on them without review could introduce bugs

This reinforced the importance of reviewing and testing any AI-generated output.

## Using AI for Debugging
I used AI to help debug a simple issue by pasting an error message and describing the behaviour I was seeing. The AI helped identify possible causes and suggested steps to narrow down the issue. While it didn’t always give the exact solution, it helped guide my thinking and saved time compared to searching blindly.

## Using AI to Learn New Concepts
AI was useful when learning new concepts because it could:
- Explain ideas at different levels of complexity
- Provide examples alongside explanations
- Answer follow-up questions quickly

This made learning feel more interactive and less intimidating.

## When AI Is Most Useful for Coding
I think AI is most useful when:
- Writing repetitive or boilerplate code
- Getting unstuck on small bugs or errors
- Learning new technologies or concepts
- Reviewing or improving existing code

AI is less useful when making architectural decisions, working with sensitive data, or writing critical logic without human review.
