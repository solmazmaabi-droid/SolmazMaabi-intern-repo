📌 Git Setup & Document Your Knowledge

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I have used Git before. I mainly used it for university assignments and personal projects to manage code changes and upload work to GitHub. My experience included basic tasks such as cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates, but I have not used Git extensively in a professional team workflow before this internship.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose to use **Git in Visual Studio Code** as my Git client.

I chose VS Code because:

- Git is built into the editor, so it is convenient and requires no extra software
- It provides a clear visual view of changes (diffs), staged files, and commit history
- Staging and committing changes is easier to understand through the interface
- I can manage code and version control in one place, which reduces context switching

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned is that Git tracks changes **locally first**. Commits happen on my computer and do not affect the remote repository (GitHub) until I push. Understanding the difference between local commits and pushing to a remote repository made the workflow clearer and helped me understand how Git supports safe collaboration.
